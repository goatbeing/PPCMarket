# ENS Marketplace Frontend

Next.js application for the ENS Marketplace.

## ðŸš€ **No Custom Contracts Needed!**

This marketplace uses **OpenSea's Seaport protocol** directly - no custom smart contracts required!

**How it works:**
1. **Seaport Contract**: Already deployed at `0x0000000000000068F116a894984e2DB1123eB395`
2. **Your Frontend**: Connects users to Seaport via `@opensea/seaport-js`
3. **ENS NFTs**: Work out-of-the-box since they're ERC-721 tokens

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Zero deployment costs for contracts
- âœ… Battle-tested security (OpenSea uses this)
- âœ… Compatible with all ENS domains
- âœ… Gas-efficient trading
